    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      At SafeStay, we believe everyone deserves to feel at home.

      Our platform connects caring individuals and organizations with opportunities to sponsor hotel rooms and other forms of temporary housing for people experiencing homelessness. By working together, we provide more than just shelter — we offer dignity, comfort, and the foundation for a fresh start. SafeStay is built on compassion, community, and the simple idea that when we care for each other, everyone is safer.
